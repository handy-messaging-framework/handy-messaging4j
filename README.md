# Handy-Messaging4J
Asynchronous messaging is one of the fundamental pillars of any distributed system. In this day and age, there is no scarcity of such asynchronous messaging platforms. Though these messaging systems have different implementation methods the core of what they offer pretty much stays the same - A publisher produces a message and one or more consumers can subscribe to that message though a topic or a queue. The consumers on receiving the message will process the message. In essence this fundamental behavior pretty much stays the same across most of these messaging systems. Though these messaging systems have plus and minus features to these fundamental behavior, there is no such standard framework for developers to interface with these messaging systems. This is the motivation for the Eclectique Messaging framework.
